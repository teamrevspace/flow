# Flow Work

Goal: make a super minimalistic productivity app that will be in the menu bar/corner and allow people to do coworking sessions in real time.

User Flow:
- log in through google, discord, github, etc
- enter a list of todo items that you need to get done during your focus block
- start a private session with friends using invite code or join a public session (i.e. rev, NEU, etc) to co-work
- switch between different work modes (do-not-disturb, pomodoro timer, etc)
- actually get shit done by seeing other people making progress and only focusing on one task at a time
- reminds you to drink water, take a break, stretch, etc
- mark your todo items as completed to earn xp and compete on leaderboard

Bonus features:
- track your screen time so you can check how productive you were
- detect inactivity to pause the session
